# CodeWiki
Idly browsing your phone? Why not spend that time to learn new APIs?

Lead your own adventure through the CodeWiki, or leave your fate up to RNG!

## Development Plans
* Kotlin
* Randomize resource
* Add search bar
* Filter by tags
* Indefinite timeline (am busy with other projects/work)

## Contributors
Accepting any and all contributors. The goal is to make an Android app to publish on the Google Play Store because I own an Android phone, but I would like to see CodeWiki dominate iOS and other platforms.
